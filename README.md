### THE FRONTEND DESIGN FOR A CAR VIEWING WEBSITE WHERE ER GET DETAILS FROM 2 DIFFERENT API'S

## YOU CAN SEARCH FOR A CAR BY THE NAME OF MANUFACTURER AND MODEL NAME. ALSO YOU CAN FILTER BY THE TYPE OF FUEL AND THE YEAR OF MANUFACTURE

## THE SHOW MORE BUTTON WILL PROVIDE MORE CARS ONLY IF THERE ARE NO FILTER CRITERIAS PRESENT

## THERE IS A BUG FOR NEXT JS 13.4 WHERE THE PAGE AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO THE START IF THE SEARCH PARAMETERS ARE UPDATED IN THE URL. LINK TO THE DISCUSSION : https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/49087
